	clustering is one of the techniques that can expand the lifespan

	In this paper, we present an energy-aware clustering for wireless

	protocol developed for WSNs, LEACH (low-energy adaptive clustering

	These methods should be capable to adapt quickly to unexpected changes

	methods may lead to new advancements in science and technology and
	in understanding Nature. In this presentation methods for signal

	addressed including ant <span class='snippet'>optimization</span>,
	<span class='snippet'>swarm</span> intelligence and genetic algorithms.
	However, the emphasis of the presentation is on Monte Carlo-based

	filtering, cost-reference <span class='snippet'>particle</span> filtering,
	and population Monte Carlo. In the past decade and a half, Monte
	Carlo-based methods have gained considerable popularity in dealing

	The three groups of methods share the feature that they explore spaces

Swarm intelligence is used to locate objects by optimizing the classification confidence level.

An important feature of this algorithm is a balance between particle attraction to the centre of mass and repulsive, collision avoiding forces. These forces are not present in the classic particle swarm optimisation algorithms. A number of experiments illuminate the nature of these new forces and it is suggested that the algorithm may have applications to dynamic optimisation problems},

	abstract = {Swarm intelligence, as demonstrated by natural biological swarms, exhibits numerous powerful features that are desirable in many engineering systems, such as communication networks. In addition, new paradigms for designing autonomous and scalable systems may result from analytically understanding and extending the design principles and operations inherent in intelligent biological swarms. A key element of future design paradigms will be emergent intelligence - simple local interactions of autonomous swarm members, with simple primitives, giving rise to complex and intelligent global behavior. Communication network management is becoming increasingly difficult due to the increasing network size, rapidly changing topology, and complexity. A new class of algorithms, inspired by swarm intelligence, is currently being developed that can potentially solve numerous problems of such networks. These algorithms rely on the interaction of a multitude of simultaneously interacting agents. A survey of such algorithms and their performance is presented here},
